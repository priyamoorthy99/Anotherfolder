In githublearning folder we take it from github to local folder, its totally understand.
Now we are going to create another folder in local and going to connect in github.
So, firstly we use "git init" command to initialize the folder to github which is located in the local.
Now In github we need to create another repository to store the folder which is created in local.
Now we need to add that repository origin link in the vs code using "git remote add origin that link" and the repository is linked to vs code.
Then we need to change the branch name from "master" to "main" using "git brand -M main" command.
Now its changed the brand name.
